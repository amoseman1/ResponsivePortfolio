# ResponsivePortfolio

This is a self-portfolio created to showcase the responsiveness of the site for different media queries.

By creating 3 diffrent .html files to link together this project had many more components and staying organized was a challenge. However, in the future, I will be linking a separate css file for each document, instead of trying to keep track of what on the css file was manipulating files where.

I also struggled with figuring out which element of the pre-made bootstrap components was the correct one to reference for CSS styling of that element. This is something I will need to work on.

I wasn't able to get my About page to be centered like I had hoped, I will work on that more in the fututre too , and create a grid layout that keeps the text inside the card component, instead of falling out.

My footer didn't work as a container, but I will fix that for the future as well I did get my Github link to work, which will be relevant and useful for employeement.
